Apple Script to create a bootable macOS pendrive
This is just an utility I've made because I always forget the correct path and arguments to create a bootable macOS pendrive. The AppleScript will just setup the correct command and then move it to the Terminal.app to continue the process from there.

## How to use
You can download the binary [HERE](https://github.com/Bunn/macOSToPendrive/releases/download/1.0/macOSToPendrive.app.zip) (It's not signed) or clone the repo and run the script directly.


Select your macOS installation app

![chooseMacOS](/images/chooseMacOS.png?raw=true "chooseMacOS")



Select the drive you want to install macOS on

![chooseVolume](/images/chooseVolume.png?raw=true "chooseVolume")



Follow up the instructions on the terminal

![terminal](/images/terminal.png?raw=true "terminal")
